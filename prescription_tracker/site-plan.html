      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>How often do you forget to refill your medication until it's too late and you've run out? It can be hard to keep track, especially when you have multiple medications and for multiple people. I created a website where you can enter your medications, and their refill dates, according to who needs them. All the information is accessible in one place, so that you can tell at a glance what's needing to be refilled.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience is for anyone who uses medication on a regular basis - diabetics, cancer patients, autoimmune patients, etc. I think that families and people who take multiple medications will get the most out of it because there are multiple refill dates, some medications need new prescriptions every month, and maybe some of them need to be filled at a specialty pharmacy. It takes a lot of mental load to keep track of all of that information, especially for multiple people.</p>  <!-- change this -->

          Who Will Benefit?
          This site is for people who need help keeping track of multiple prescriptions. They will be able to add the prescription, who it is for, what pharmacy fills it, how many refills are left, and when the next refill is due.
          Who Benefits Most?
          This website will be especially helpful for seniors, and families with multiple people taking medications. It can be easy to lose track of your prescriptions, but imagine being able to pull up a website, see all of your prescriptions on one page, and know exactly which ones need refills, and which pharmacy fills it! You can add an unlimited number of medications with an unlimited number of people who take them.
          No More Worries!
          Of all the things we have to worry about every day, our medications should not be on that list. Giving up the mental load that medications cause allows for more stress-free interactions with your doctor and your pharmacist.

        About Us
        Site Origin
        This website was created by a woman who got tired of trying to keep mental tabs on all of her family’s medications. It was extremely inconvenient for her to go take a pill, and realize that she ran out yesterday and completely forgot to get it refilled. Now she had to wait for the pharmacy to fill it, and sometimes for the doctor to approve the refill.

        We know how important it is that you are able to keep up with your medications, and have them when you need them. Your physical, mental, and overall wellbeing is important to us, as well as the safety of the data that you entrust to us.

        Website features and functionality
        Benefits of Website
        This website doesn’t have all of the fluff that other websites do – no mood trackers, food trackers, health journals, etc. And best of all, it’s free! Other websites may charge hundreds of dollars for access to their trackers.
        Medications We Support
        Our website supports all kinds of medications, from insulin injections, anxiety medication, creams, and even over-the-counter medication. It is easy to add and remove medications, change pharmacies, refill dates, and even add notes or comments about your medication.
        Notes and Comments
        Did you experience a new symptom you aren’t sure about? Is the dosage not helping you as well as it used to? Perhaps you wish to ask your doctor if there are any similar medications that you could try instead? Maybe you and your doctor are trying to find a medication that works well for you, and you need to write down your thoughts to share with your doctor about your current medication. We provide a place to add notes for each medication, so that you will never forget the important information you need to share with your doctor.
