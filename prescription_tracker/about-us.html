            <img src="images/pile_of_pills.jpg" alt="a pile of pills">
            <p>This website was created by a woman who got tired of trying to keep mental tabs on all of her familyâ€™s medications. It was extremely inconvenient for her to go take a pill, and realize that she ran out yesterday and completely forgot to get it refilled. Now she had to wait for the pharmacy to fill it, and sometimes for the doctor to approve the refill. </p>
